How to sue the program:  
Once the program is run the user can log in using a super user There is already one created.  
You can add booked movies to that user or look at movies taht he has already booked  

API:  
I already have 3 movies and 5 seats added. The user can pick the seats they want for the specific movie.  
To add things to the API you can go to the API page logged in as a super user and can add movies or seats.  

Resources:
Since I was new to Django and this type of archetecture I heavly rellied on chatgpt and disscussions with some class mates. I also am running the container locally so I had some issues dealing with that, but got it figured out for the most part.
